## Acknowlegement

- I took up this project as a lockdown hobby but later turned it into a serious project as I had to do something for my University Assignment.

- The pandemic was very booring and monotonic so I thought of making something which is necessary and fulfils the following criterias :-

  1. Useful

  2. Easy to use

  3. Minimalistic UX design

  4. Uses some GUI framework

- The calculators already available online had the following shortcommings according to my study on calculator applications :-

  1. Complex to use

  2. Had a very basic design

  3. Had no themes

  4. Had no special features

  5. Had no have Scientific mode

  6. Was not so user friendly

- Also those days I could'nt find an appropriate calculator application online which suited my choice and designs.

- So I thought why not try to build one for myself and the community. :)
